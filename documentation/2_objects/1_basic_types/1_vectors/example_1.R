# R has six basic (‘atomic’) vector types: logical, integer, real, complex, string (or character) and raw. The modes and storage modes for the different vector types are listed in the following table.

# typeof	mode	storage.mode
# logical	logical	logical
# integer	numeric	integer
# double	numeric	double
# complex	complex	complex
# character	character	character
# raw	raw	raw

# Single numbers, such as 4.2, and strings, such as "four point two" are still vectors, of length 1; there are no more basic types. Vectors with length zero are possible (and useful).

# String vectors have mode and storage mode "character". A single element of a character vector is often referred to as a character string.
